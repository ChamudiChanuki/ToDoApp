üß© To-Do Task Web Application

A small full-stack app that lets you add tasks, list the 5 most recent active tasks, and mark them Done.
Everything runs via Docker Compose (DB, API, UI). Includes backend (xUnit) and frontend (Jest/RTL) tests.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Run Instructions
Prereqs: Docker Desktop + Docker Compose.

From the repository root:

build + start all services (db, api, frontend):
docker compose up --build

URLs:

Frontend: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:3000/)

Backend (Swagger): [http://localhost:5000/swagger](http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html)

Stop & clean up/:

docker compose down

üß™ Testing

API Testing & Code Coverage

This project uses xUnit for testing, FluentAssertions for readable assertions, and ReportGenerator for code-coverage reports.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running Tests with Code Coverage

1Ô∏è‚É£ Run all tests and collect coverage
dotnet test tests/Todo.Api.Tests/Todo.Api.Tests.csproj --configuration Release --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

This command:

Builds the test project in Release mode

Runs all xUnit tests

Collects coverage data in Cobertura XML format (saved under TestResults)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install the report generator tool
dotnet tool update -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool


This installs (or updates) the global ReportGenerator tool that converts the raw coverage data into human-readable HTML reports.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Generate the HTML report
reportgenerator -reports:"tests/*/TestResults/*/coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"coverage" -reporttypes:Html;HtmlSummary

This command:

Reads coverage results from any test projects under tests/

Outputs the report to a folder called coverage/

Generates both detailed (Html) and summary (HtmlSummary) reports

4Ô∏è‚É£ View the coverage report

After generation, open the report in your browser:

.\coverage\index.html

You‚Äôll see line-coverage and branch-coverage percentages for each file, class, and method.


üß© Notes

Line Coverage = lines of code executed at least once

Branch Coverage = both sides of if/else conditions executed

Coverage data is stored automatically under tests/Todo.Api.Tests/TestResults/

To increase branch coverage, add test cases for all alternate paths (e.g., invalid input, not-found scenarios).
